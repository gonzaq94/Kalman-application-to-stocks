<h1>Kalman application to stocks</h1>

Application of the standard and extended Kalman filters to an AR-N Model (autoregressive model) that intends to represent the variation of stocks (or, in practice, any temporal series) in time.

KalmanForStocksv7.m: algorithms with measurement and prediction steps.

KalmanForStocksv8.m: algorithms without any measurements for 15 days (only predictions).

KalmanForStocksBarridoMatrices.m: calculates MSE for different variances of the process and meausurement noises.
